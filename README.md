# My-certificates



This repository contains certificates from courses / exams / competitions that I received. 



A complete list of the courses I have taken and some descriptions are given in the table `Courses` below. All courses certificates can be verified by link in `Certificate link` column. 

Also, all certificates have been downloaded and stored in the  `courses/` folder in this repository. The typical certificate filename is `UniversityAbbreviation_CourseName.pdf`
